"If that company were founded today, what would it look like with AI in the driver’s seat?"

## 💭 What is Periodically. ?

Periodically is not a period tracker. It’s a **fundamental paradigm shift in personalized health AI** a platform where you converse with a wiser version of yourself, powered by your own data and patterns.

* You are the expert.
Our AI learns from your journal, voice, mood, and cycle, not from generic population averages.
* Hyper-personalized insights.
The app reflects your unique patterns, moods, and health correlations, empowering you to understand yourself.
* AI as your companion.
Not a chatbot, but a digital twin trained on your lived experience.
